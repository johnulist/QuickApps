<h3>About</h3>
<p>
    The Field module allows custom data fields to be defined for <em>entity</em> types 
    (entities include content items, comments, user accounts or any <b>Model</b> in general). 
    The Field module takes care of storing, loading, editing, and rendering field data. 
    Most users will not interact with the Field module directly, but will instead use the <em>Field GUI</a>. 
    Module developers can use the Field API to make new entity types "fieldable" and thus allow fields to be attached to them.

        The Field module provides the infrastructure for fields and field attachment; 
        the field types and input are provided by additional modules. 
        Some of the modules are required; the optional modules can be enabled from the 
        <a href="<?php echo $this->Html->url('/admin/system/modules'); ?>">Modules administration page</a>.
